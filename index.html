      Coal is Killing the West Virginia Communities it Created

    <p>  <font size="+2"> When you take a drive through the city of Welch, West Virginia, you see poverty. Abandoned stores litter the main drag of Bank Street. Houses that held up to 6,500 residents at the town's peak, now accommodate less than 2,000. But why? Welch once had a proud economy, but now its population is plunged farther and farther below the poverty line. It all revolves around the center of the town’s economic center, coal.

</p>
    <p>According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration the production of coal took a nosedive in the late 2000s. Welch, like many other rural West Virginia towns, tried to diversify in order to combat the decline in coal. But by the time attempts were made, it was too late. Dr. John Deskins, the Director of the Bureau of Business & Economic Research at West Virginia University, calls it a “vicious cycle.”

</p>
    <p>The county most definitely was lacking in industrial diversification,” said Deskins. “So that means we had way too much reliance on one industry. So then we start to see job losses. When job losses happen, for whatever reason, in many cases people have to move away to find new jobs.”

</p>
    <p>
      Mcdowell county, where Welch is located, is a small county in the bottom west corner of the state. There are 43 different coal mining towns on Mcdowell’s two “coal plains,” combining to hold the county’s 19,000 or so residents. Those residents have relied on the value of coal to make a living since the area was first mined in the early 19th century. Now, what was once a source of economic prosperity, has turned into McDowell's ultimate downfall.

    <p>While West Virginia’s GDP per capita has risen, McDowell has seen stark economic downturns that have resulted in rapid business closures. Being one of the most economically challenged counties, in a state with the third lowest GDP per capita in the nation already doesn’t bode well. The county’s office for economic development sits on one of Welch’s empty streets, symbolic of its loss of production, and now loss of youth.


   </p> 

   <p> “When people migrate out, migrants tend to be younger, healthier, better educated, better trained, better prepared for the workforce,” said Deskins. “So the outmigration makes the area older, less healthy, less educated, less prepared for the workforce.”

    <p>Since the decline in the production of coal in the late 2000s, the population of McDowell has shrunk swiftly. This mass exodus or “brain drain” has depleted the smaller mining centric communities leaving some to rot. Without many economic opportunities, and few people willing to invest in counties like McDowell, it creates a snowballing problem. 
</p>
<p> “That's the vicious cycle,” said Deskins. “And the tools that we have for economic development, it's very hard to use those tools to take negative momentum and turn that into growth. The tools that we have are better suited to taking an area that's growing.”
</p>
<p> So what’s being done to save counties like McDowell? It has mostly fallen on the shoulders of the community itself, rather than government assistance. 
</p>
<p> “The government certainly is trying to find new opportunities and trying to attract new businesses,” said Deskins. But we have 55 counties in West Virginia altogether. McDowell County is one county where it's been especially difficult to really create momentum.”
</p>
<p> Much of McDowell’s attempted rejuvenation leans on the tourism industry. While it may not give off the appearance of a vacation destination, citizens of the county have begun to use the same land that has seen them flourish and drown, for new opportunities.
</p>
<p> “In McDowell County, there are some groups that are looking to boost different kinds of tourism, adventure tourism, " said Deskins. For example, people are going four wheeling out on these trails in the middle of nowhere on kind of rugged terrain.”

    <p> <font size="+2">Despite that attempted surge in tourism, the population continues to steadily decline. No travel agency or adventure tourism setup can provide the massive amount of jobs to keep the town afloat. When compared to national unemployment statistics, McDowell county largely follows the national trend, just slightly higher. However, those statistics are a facade. The county’s unemployment rate, while not a glaring sign of economic disaster, is mostly maintained by a steady flow of families leaving in search of new jobs.

  <p> There are potential new avenues to try to create momentum, to try to create some positive spark,” said Deskins. “But the potential positives vary from community to community, and sometimes they're kind of easier to pursue in some cases than in others.” 
</p>
<p>
  The potential positives of the past have now torn the county down from the inside. When that single industry started to wilt away, so did the towns it fed. And while the proverbial nail has yet to be put in McDowell’s coffin, without drastic fixes, the writing is on the wall.
